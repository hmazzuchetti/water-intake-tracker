  1. Right-click on WaterIntakeTracker.exe
  2. Click "Properties"
  3. At the bottom, check the box "Unblock"
  4. Click "OK"
  5. Now double-click to run normally

METHOD 2 (When you see the blue screen):
  1. Click "More info" (small text link)
  2. Click "Run anyway"

------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS:
  - Windows 10 or 11

FIRST RUN:
  - The app will show a setup screen
  - Select your webcam from the dropdown
  - Click "Test Camera" to verify it works
  - Adjust settings as needed

HOW IT WORKS:
  - The app uses your webcam to detect when you drink water
  - A progress bar shows your daily intake

TIPS:
  - If detection isn't working, try enabling "Require cup/bottle"
  - Select your dominant drinking hand for better accuracy
  - Double-click the progress bar to undo accidental detections
